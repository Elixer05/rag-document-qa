# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Document Question Answering

A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that performs semantic search over multi-chapter academic documents and generates context-grounded answers using a local LLM.

The system retrieves relevant sections from textbook content and uses them as context for answer generation.

## Architecture

PDF Documents → Chunking → Embeddings → Retrieval → LLM Generation

1. Documents are split into overlapping chunks.
2. Each chunk is converted into a semantic embedding.
3. Relevant chunks are retrieved using cosine similarity.
4. Retrieved context is passed to a local LLM to generate answers.

## Installation

Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-document-qa.git
cd rag-document-qa
```

Create a virtual environment

```
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate it

```
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running the System

Make sure Ollama is running locally with the required model.

```
ollama run llama2
```

Run the application

```
python app.py
```

---

## Example Use Case

Ask questions from academic textbooks such as:

```
What is the working principle of a PN junction diode?
```

The system retrieves the most relevant sections from the document and generates a context-grounded answer.
